# EXCEL-Dashboard.fun
This project was a fun and hands-on experience in data cleaning and visualization using Excel to analyze the sales trend of cars. 
I started with a messy, uncleaned dataset and applied a series of data-cleaning techniques, such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates, to make the data ready for analysis.
The core of the project is an interactive dashboard created entirely in Excel, using features like pivot tables, Slicers, charts, and conditional formatting. The dashboard is designed to present key insights in a clear and simple way, making it easy for anyone—regardless of technical background—to understand the dataset.
